*yet another jQuery slider plugin*

Like most of us I have a few go-to slider plugins that I use on a regular basis. However I have been less and less
happy with the compact slider I usually use for super-simple sliders; it feels clunky and just isn't cutting it. I spent
quite a bit of time looking over the many, many sliders available but couldn't find anything I was really happy with 
(and confident enough in to start using in production). I decided it would be easier just to write a tiny little slider that 
does the few things I need it to. Here it is! 
This is probably the most limited slider on earth, but at <b>1.5k</b> <sub>(minified)</sub> it isn't going to be a powerhouse. 
If all you need is one of the limited functions this might just do the trick.

##Browser support
	
#####this is largely based on what jQuery you are using. Tested as far back as 1.2.3, works all the way up to current 2.0.3 

+IE 7+
+Windows Mobile 8
+Firefox (tested in 27.0)
+Chrome (tested in 32)
+Chrome mobile
+Opera mobile
+Safari (tested back to 5.1)
+android native browser

*I am sure compatability goes back much further than this, the combination of browser access/available time to commit to testing limited me to the list above.*

##Usage
	
Include the script after your jquery, like so:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path_to_script/bityslider.min.js"></script>
```
There are two methods for calling the slider.

**SUPER LAZY METHOD**
give your slider div the class name "bityslider". Example:
```
<div class="bityslider">
<!--each element inside becomes a slide-->
</div> 
```
the bityslider div defaults to a "fade" technique, slidng every 5 seconds.

**SLIGHTLY LESS LAZY METHOD**

call the bityslider function on a div, any diy you want. You can pass 2 params to it- speed and type.
1.**Speed**- the time between slides in microseconds. 5000 is 5 seconds, 2500 is 2.5 seconds etc.
2.**Type**- the type of slide. Current options are "fade","shrink" and "wipe".

So for examle if you have a div with an id of `dim_8`,
and you wanted to slide the contents every 3 seconds
using a shrinking effect in the transition, it would look like this: 	

```
<div id="dim_8">
<img id="buckaroo_banzai">
<article id="john_bigboote"></article>
<a id="penny_priddy"></a>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function(){
$('dim_8').bittyslider(3000,"shrink");
});
</script>	
```				
That is just about it! Hope this saves you a couple of minutes. Please feel free to fork and make additions if you
get the itch.
