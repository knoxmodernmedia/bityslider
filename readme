	<i>
		yet another jQuery slider plugin
	</i>
	<br/>
	<p>
		Like most of us I have a few go-to slider plugins that I use on a regular basis. However I have been less and less
		happy with the compact slider I usually use for super-simple sliders; it feels clunky and just isn't cutting it. I spent
		quite a bit of time looking over the many, many sliders available but couldn't find anything I was really happy with 
		(and confident enough in to start using in production). I decided it would be easier just to write a tiny little slider that 
		does the few things I need it to. Here it is! 
		This is probably the most limited slider on earth, but at <b>1.5k</b> <sub>(minified)</sub> it isn't going to be a powerhouse. 
		If all you need is one of the limited functions this might just do the trick.

 		Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings... and a web developer makes another slider plugin.

	<h3>
		Browser support
	</h3>
	<sub>
		this is largely based on what jQuery you are using. Tested as far back as 1.2.3, works all the way up to current 2.0.3 
	</sub>
	<ul>
		<li>
			IE 7+
		</li>
		<li>
			Windows Mobile 8
		</li>
		<li>
			Firefox (tested in 27.0)
		</li>
		<li>
			Chrome (tested in 32)
		</li>
		<li>
			Chrome mobile
		</li>
		<li>
			Opera mobile
		</li>
		<li>
			Safari (tested back to 5.1)
		</li>
		<li>
			android native browser
		</li>
	<ul>
	<p>
		I am sure compatability goes back much further than this, the combination of browser access/available time to commit to testing 
		limited me to the list above.

	<h2>
		Usage
	</h2>
		<p>
			Include the script after your jquery, like so:
		</p>
		<pre>
			<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
			<script type="text/javascript" src="path_to_script/bityslider.min.js"></script>
		</pre>
		<p>
			There are two methods for calling the slider.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>
					SUPER LAZY METHOD
				</b>
				<br/>
					give your slider div the class name "bityslider". Example:
					<pre>
						<div class="bityslider">
							<!--each element inside becomes a slide-->
						</div> 
					</pre>
					the bityslider div defaults to a "fade" technique, slidng every 5 seconds.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>
					SLIGHTLY LESS LAZY METHOD
				</b>
				<br/>
					call the bityslider function on a div, any diy you want. You can pass 2 params to it- speed and type.
					<br/>
					<u>Speed</u>- the time between slides in microseconds. 5000 is 5 seconds, 2500 is 2.5 seconds etc.
					<br/>
					<u>Type</u>- the type of slide. Current options are "fade","shrink" and "wipe".
					<br/>
					So for examle if you have a div with an id of `dim_8`,
					 and you wanted to slide the contents every 3 seconds
					 using a shrinking effect in the transition, it would look like this: 	
		 		<pre>
		 			<div id="dim_8">
		 				
		 				<img id="buckaroo_banzai">
		 				
		 				<article id="john_bigboote"></article>
		 				
		 				<a id="penny_priddy"></a>
		 				
	 				</div>
	 				
	 				<script type="text/javascript">
	 				
	 				$(document).ready(function(){
	 				
	 					$('dim_8').bittyslider(3000,"shrink");
		 			
		 			});
		 			</script>	
				</pre>
				
			</li>
			
			<p>
				That is just about it! Hope this saves you a couple of minutes. Please feel free to fork and make additions if you
				get the itch.
